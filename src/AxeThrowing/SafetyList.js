Loose clothing such as hooded sweatshirts, shawls, scarves, and accessories can also create unsafe conditions by limiting mobility and/or snagging on objects during your event. For the same reason, brimmed hats are also discouraged. Your Dungeon Master will exercise his/her discretion when meeting your group – and you may be asked to remove any clothing items or accessories which could present a safety risk. We trust you and your group will cooperate."
